### Project: Survin

Survin is a desktop application for surveyors to use to keep track of people they have surveyed. The surveyor can easily follow up with people they have surveyed for additional information or for confirmation. The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add ability to add new surveyees.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add new surveyees using a text command.
  * Justification: While the feature was already included in the v1.0, it had to be changed to suit the new use case of surveyees.
  * Highlights: Updated the model to accept new attributes like race, religion. Updated the command to accept these new parameters.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

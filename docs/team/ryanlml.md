### Project: Survin

Survin is a desktop application for surveyors to use to keep track of people they have surveyed. The surveyor can easily follow up with people they have surveyed for additional information or for confirmation. The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view surveyees with given attributes.
  * What it does: allows the user to search for surveyees via attributes.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to filter all surveyees of a given demographic, say, chinese christian females.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
